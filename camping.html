    <h3>Struggles of First Time Campers</h3>
     
     <p>
     
        Since I moved to Sweden, I have adopted and tried many things that I never did in my own country, and camping is one such activity. Thus, the year 2022 marks the year when I found out that camping is my favorite kind of vacation. Away from all the hustle of city life, peace and calm along the beach or in the jungle. 
        From kids' apparel to stuff for cooking, I had to pack a lot. Throughout this entire period, the only thing that provided a sigh of relief was the fact that the friend who joined us was equally perplexed as we were. Our car was stuffed as if you put small pebbles in a glass bottle, and the only room left is for the sand particles. In our case, our car was already packed with camping gear, and the only space left was for us to squeeze ourselves in. Finally, we started our journey. Nu kör vi! (Let’s go in Swedish.)
       It was the last weekend of May, and the weather was pleasant, but rain was expected at night, which we completely ignored while considering other factors that we regretted later. We reached there in the afternoon, and until the evening, the weather was acceptable. After a few hours of fun, chatter, and multiple sessions os snacking, it was finally time for our first night in the camp, and that is when the real adventure started. 
       Around 3 a.m., we woke up to the sound of heavy rain pouring on the polyester flysheet of our tent. Besides the rain, the strong winds made the whole scene more dramatic, and it felt as if our camp was going to fly away with it. The temperature had fallen to 5 degrees, which was very cold for the first time campers who were unprepared for this weather. All of us were glued to each other to lessen the cold effect. Thanks to my last minute wisdom, I picked up the kids’ warm hats and socks while coming out of the house. Both of my girls were lying on my arms, one on each side, and my toddler was lying on my top. We had tightly wrapped our quilt under our feet. Mr. Husband was on his side of the tent and was shivering alone. I was trying to move my younger girl a little away so that i could feel my toddler's feet to see if they were cold or not. Yes, he was a bit cold but got warmth from my body. Luckily, our jackets were nearby, so I asked my girls to wear their jackets above their fleece jackets. They quickly followed my instructions and crawled back to me. Both my girls had wrapped their legs and arms around me as if strapped to an ambulance stretcher. I could barely move. 
       Worst of all, we all needed to go to the toilet. It was still raining, strong winds were still playing their part in the whole scene, and we were all shivering with cold. We spent almost two hours in the same position, hoping and praying for the weather to get better. At five in the morning, Mother Nature finally had mercy on us, and the rain stopped. We came out of the tents to run to the toilet. What we witnessed next made us forget our miserable situation a few moments ago. We saw lush green trees that appeared washed and fresh after the rain, as well as a beautiful clear sky and a beautiful dawn.
       After another round of sleep, we woke up and had our breakfast together. The previous night had made us reconsider our next two days. As kids, we wanted to spend more time, so we continued with our plan and had much more fun beside the beach.
